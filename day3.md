# Day 3 – Processes & Monitoring

## Commands Learned
- ps aux → list all running processes
- top → real-time system monitor
- uptime → system load & running time
- grep → filter text
- kill PID → stop a process
- kill -9 PID → force stop
- free -m → check memory
- df -h → check disk usage

## Practice Done
- Started a long-running ping process
- Found the PID using ps + grep
- Killed the process using kill
- Monitored CPU, memory, and load
- Checked disk and memory usage

## Why This Matters in DevOps
These skills help in:
- Debugging high CPU usage
- Killing stuck containers/services
- Troubleshooting production incidents
- Understanding server performance
